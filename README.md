- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThatGraham
- 👀 I’m interested in smoothing out the rough edges of the daily grind.  By day I design new ways of using mobile robots.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of python.  Be gentle!  But let me know if you have ideas on how to do better.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an inspiring project that's approachable for beginners.
- 📫 Reach me at davisga+github@gmail.com
